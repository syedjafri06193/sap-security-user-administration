# SAP Security & User Administration Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in **SAP Security and User Administration**, aligned with **RISE with SAP** security best practices. It showcases how to design, implement, and govern secure access within an SAP cloud landscape, focusing on role-based access control (RBAC), authorization concepts, and continuous access reviews.

This repository is intended for recruiters, hiring managers, and technical reviewers looking to evaluate practical SAP security knowledge through documentation, processes, and artifacts.
